title: Welcome!

On this website, I document my projects. I use the term "project" in a broad
sense, as in
[GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/2017/05/managing-projects-with-gtd/):

> "Projects are defined as outcomes that will require more than one action step
> to complete and that you can mark off as finished in the next 12 months."

They are numbered and listed in no specific order.
